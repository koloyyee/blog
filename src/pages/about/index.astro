    This blog is about my journey in programming, the mistakes I made, and the things
    I have learned. Lessons I have learnt can be a subject at the college I am attending,
    a course on Coursera, or any lesson I came across during my dev time.

    <h3 class="text-2xl dark:text-amber-400">About me.</h3>
    <p>
      A little bit about myself, my name is <strong>Loyyee Ko</strong> or you can
      call me <strong>David</strong>,
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my journey in 2016 but nothing serious, just started to try out
      HTML, CSS, and JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back then I was still a chef, after surgery, I knew that one day I would
      leave the food and beverage industry,
    </p>
    <p>
      and programming is equally fun and frustrating as cooking because I can
      make all sorts of products.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Between now and then, I learned half a dozen languages, a number of
      frameworks, and even attended a coding boot camp, but none of that effort
      got me a programmer role until I finally said "no more other languages" I
      believe to go deeper into the world of JavaScript and TypeScript.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It paid off, I landed my job as a frontend developer in Hong Kong and I
      learnt a lot by just working by myself and reading other's work. 8 months
      later, I found myself here in Ottawa, Canada, finally the leap to attend a
      proper college to learn programming, I am glad I made the decision and
      begin my journey with Java, and I finally took the time to learn all the
      programming basics again.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This is my journey in the world of programming, I do not fear of A.I, I
      fear my Shinny Object Syndrome that leads me nowhere but in the same spot.
