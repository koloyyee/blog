# Improvement
We often think once the project it is done all we do is to either add features or maintain it, but is it? I am fortunate enough to live in and travel to different countries allows me to compare between cities, why a city is "better" than the other? Why people believe Tokyo is more "futuristic" or modern than North American cities? Constant improvement is the key.

Recently I have travelled to Toronto and I start to notice some neighborhood like Cabbagetown, Dupont, or Danforth are close to the downtown while the infrastructures such as buildings and electricity grid still stuck in the past. While the population is booming in Canada especially Toronto for past decades, the city does not seem to take actions to think how the city should evolve to meet the need, which I believe eventually lead to housing crisis here in Canada.

## Strategy changes to meet demand.

Although these large houses looks nice and cozy for a single family but the reality is it usually turned into sharedhouses or Airbnbs. I argue instead of keeping single family houses in the region close to the downtown, they should be torn down and replaced by 5-6 floors apartments with 12-18 smaller individual units, with 2 large single family house of land, there could be 12-18 family units, and with public transportation there is no need for owning a car when living in the city.

Let's face it with lower birthrate families are usually small, large houses in the middle of the city doesn't make sense, young individuals or couples without child they smaller units works well, until they decided it is time to have children maybe it is the right time to move to suburb for larger space and touch grass.


## Refactoring
When I look at the power supply in Canada with lots of wire hanging in the outdoor that makes me question "why not have them underground?". Of course, I am not a civil engineer there might be reasons behind it but I don't see these wires in the newer neighborhoods, is it because "if it is not broken why fix it" mentality? Should we wait until it is broken to change it?

Toyota has a famous term when it comes to manufacturing, Kaizen. Kaizen is the word means improvement both in Japanese and Chinese, the constant state of questioning how to improve the process and product is the reason Toyota is constantly winning, if you travel to Japan you will find roads and utilities are well maintained and constantly improving, although they serve the same purpose since day one but as time change better technology helps to improve the older system to meet the demand. Not only in public utilities, you can see the constant improvement in public transportations, food and beverage chains in Asia are all improving and competing constantly, and seems like North America forgot the importance of competition and improvement overtime.

I believe living in downtown area is about convenience and opportunities, refactoring the housing grid in the city means more people can live and work in the city that create more opportunities, creativities, and diversity. Instead of just suburb and business parks and single family homes, young people in their 20s and 30s needs to have an unit to be stable and grow, when government pushing to rebuild the city with newer, denser buildings this could help to drive down rental prices and housing prices if the government willing to put in the effort.
