# Do you value your time?

There are any people will try to exploit person, of course, that's the nature of capitalism.
And there are the hard working person that willing to do it because of work ethics, but then the true question is "Do you value your time?".

## Employer vs Employees

The difference between an employer and the employees sometimes comes to how they deal with their time,
the employers hire people because they don't have the skill and rather than spending time on learning from scratch they just hire someone,
then they pick up the know-how and knowledge at a higher level, but since they are paying they will prioritize their time first.
But a lot of times employees will focus on the current task and get good (which is good) but forget about the value of time,
and because employees are often busy they don't get to think about the same probelm.

Like myself in the past I want to make money through grinding in a company, working hard for that employer and I hope I will be valued,
in reality, it won't. Work for yourself is the only way, value yourself and time then people will value you,
all these years in workforce I have learnt not saying "yes" to everything is important,
because I should have focus on things matters the most to me, I never say no to a feature
but I do say no to things that doesn't make my technique, knowledge, and user experience better.

## People will take advance of yourself

There are many situation people will find to exploit you,
I used to react emotionally and say things I shouldn't say,
that's not professional, and now I should think as a employer, how much ROI will this job give me?
Because time worth more than money, if I can't make a decently amount or gain the things I would like to gain,
there is no point of investing into it, I am much rather spending my time on things truly matters.

## Say No, if you have to

Being good at the job means executing the work at the highest level, and those take time,
saying no is one of the keys, don't say yes to please people, say yes because you can actually take it,
and gain from it, keep saying yes means no time left for yourself, save time for yourself and deliver high quality works.

## Value Your Time Over (Little) Money

Lastly, I just have to say, saying no politely but maintain a professional relationship can benefit to both parties,
most importantly value your time over little money and never just look at the face value.
