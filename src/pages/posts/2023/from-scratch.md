# Back to School!

I got my bachelor degree back in 2009, from that point on I was just working in
the kitchen, I can only see food in my eyes, nothing more, but after over a
decade in the kitchen I understand that hobby becoming a job might be the best
idea, and then I rekindle with my interest in technology, and so I took a chance
to learn programming, and so the journey begins.

## FreeCodeCamp

The journey was rough, in 2016, that time I didn't even know how to use Excel,
let alone `console.log("Hello, world.")`. And so I signed up for FreeCodeCamp,
the repl playground is great, or it seems great at first at least. I have no
idea what I was doing and jus following steps I print those statement and result
according to the tutorial, but to be honest I have no idea how to code.

## Tutorial Hell Gate Opens

Javascript was intimidating yet I can only print some words, then there are the
HTML and CSS makes my brain goes spinning like crazy, and I told myself "Maybe
there is a better course that I can purchase!", and so the tutorial hell begins.
First I went to Udemy to buy a web development course but all I did was typing
out whatever Rob Percival was typing, therefore I don't know how to create a
webpage, and by the way I was still using `XMLHttpRequest` in the course, so I
still can't code, and I bought another book, the cycle repeats.

## Changing the language believes the situation will change.

Then I think web development was too hard for me so I changed to a language call
Python, believing it will be better and I believe would help me in financial
investment, so I did the Python Crash Course, Automate the Boring Things, but
yet I don't know much until I have used it to create a scraper! Little did I
know the only way to learn programming is by doing.
