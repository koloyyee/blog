# Hey!ðŸ‘‹

If you made it all the way to my Github blog repo, kudos to you.

## What is the blog about?
This blog is about my journey in programming, the mistakes I made, and the things I have learned. Lessons I have learnt can be a subject at the college I am attending, a course on Coursera, or any lesson I came across during my dev time.

### About me.
A little bit about myself, my name is **Loyyee Ko**, or you can call me **David**, I started my journey in 2016 but nothing serious, just started to try out HTML, CSS, and JS. Back then I was still a chef, after surgery, I knew that one day I would leave the food and beverage industry, and programming is equally fun and frustrating as cooking because I can make all sorts of products. 

Between now and then, I learned half a dozen languages, a number of frameworks, and even attended a coding boot camp, but none of that effort got me a programmer role until I finally said "no more other languages" I believe to go deeper into the world of JavaScript and TypeScript.

It paid off, I landed my job as a frontend developer in Hong Kong and I learnt a lot by just working by myself and reading other's work. 8 months later, I found myself here in Ottawa, Canada, finally the leap to attend a proper college to learn programming, I am glad I made the decision and begin my journey with Java, and I finally took the time to learn all the programming basics again.

This is my journey in the world of programming, I do not fear of A.I, I fear my Shinny Object Syndrome that leads me nowhere but in the same spot.
